Description: Is an R package that performs gene-based pathway enrichment, 
    which can also be used as evidence for polygenic selection in case the
    software is used with selection signals evidence. The package explicitly
    also accounts for linkage desiquilibrium between adjacent loci belonging
    on the same pathway.
